# Einstein's Number Puzzle: Python Implementation

Welcome to the Einstein's Number Puzzle Python repository!

## Overview

This repository presents a Python implementation of Einstein's renowned number puzzle. Users are invited to engage with the same challenge that confounded Albert Einstein's acquaintances. By entering a three-digit number according to specific rules, players can uncover the solution.

## Theory: Core Data Structures in Python

### Introduction
This section delves into Python's fundamental data structures. Python's innate ability to discern data types without explicit declaration simplifies coding processes.

### Learning Curve
Python's minimalist syntax and interpreter-based nature facilitate a gradual learning curve, particularly beneficial for novice programmers.

### Covered Topics
Having already acquainted themselves with primitive data types like int, float, string, varchar, and bool, learners explore non-primitive data structures, including lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.

### Detailed Exploration
Each data structure is meticulously examined, highlighting its attributes, functionalities, and practical applications.

## Implementation: Einstein's Number Puzzle

### Description
The Python program provided automates the steps of Einstein's Number Puzzle, offering users an engaging and educational experience.

### How to Play
Participants are instructed to input a three-digit number adhering to specific guidelines. Regardless of the combination entered, the solution always resolves to 1098.

### Automated Steps
The program executes the necessary operations, including number reversal and subtraction, to derive the solution.

### Features
- Interactive user interface
- Automated solving mechanism
- Educational and entertaining gameplay

## Report
A detailed report elucidating the theoretical underpinnings of the puzzle and the Python program's implementation is included within this repository.

## Usage
Users can clone the repository and execute the Python program to commence playing Einstein's Number Puzzle.
